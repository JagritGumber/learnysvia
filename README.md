# Learnysvia 🎓✨

Imagine this.  
A teacher walks into class, explains a concept with energy, asks,  
**“Did everyone get it?”**  
Silence. A few nods. Some blank faces.  

The teacher moves on. But what actually happened?  
The truth often only shows up on **test day** — when it’s too late to re-explain.

## 🚀 Introducing Learnysvia

**Learnysvia** is built to fix this exact problem.  
It’s a **real-time classroom polling tool** that lets teachers check comprehension instantly.  

- Teachers create a room in **seconds**  
- Students join with a **single link** — no accounts, no friction  
- Launch a poll → see **live results** → adapt teaching on the spot  

Students answer **completely anonymously** — so honesty comes first.  
No fear, no judgment. Just quick, honest feedback that transforms teaching.  

> The goal isn’t evaluation. It’s understanding.
